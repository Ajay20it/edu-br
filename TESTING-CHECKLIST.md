## üêõ Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **Backend Integration**: Document analysis is simulated (requires AWS Textract integration)
2. **Real-time Features**: Attention detection uses simulated data
3. **User Accounts**: No user authentication system
4. **Data Persistence**: No database for storing user progress

### Future Enhancements
1. **AWS Integration**: Connect to AWS Textract for real document analysis
2. **User Management**: Implement user accounts and progress tracking
3. **Real AI**: Integrate actual attention detection algorithms
4. **Content Management**: Add admin panel for content updates
5. **Analytics**: Implement user behavior tracking
6. **Offline Support**: Add service worker for offline functionality

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Current Performance
- **HTML Files**: 9 pages, average 50KB each
- **CSS Files**: 3 files, total ~30KB
- **JavaScript**: Inline, ~20KB total
- **External Dependencies**: Minimal (Google Fonts, Font Awesome)

### Optimization Opportunities
1. **Image Optimization**: Add WebP format support
2. **Code Splitting**: Separate JavaScript by page
3. **Lazy Loading**: Implement for non-critical resources
4. **Caching Strategy**: Implement proper cache headers
